 * A single live player's editable stats. Unlike ClassSandboxProvider (which is

 * holds a Supplier<Player> to always read the currently-running player, not a
 * stale direct reference. When GamePanel.resetState() creates a new player
 * object, the supplier returns the new object immediately, so edits stay
 * synchronized with whichever player is live in the game.
