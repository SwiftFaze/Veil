# Screens

How `Main.java` assembles and navigates between the game's screens, and
how the individual screen panels compose the reusable widgets from
`docs/ui-widgets.md` into player-facing UI. For the shared list/detail
data contract Inventory and Codex use to display domain content, see
`docs/components.md`.

**UI shell** (`ui/`): removed (`EastPanel`, `NorthPanel`, `SouthPanel`,
`PlayerInfoPanel`, `TerminalPanel`) as early scaffolding pending a proper
reimplementation — `GamePanel` currently has no sidebar and no title bar.
`Main.buildGameCard`/`wirePopups` now do just enough plumbing to keep
`InventoryPanel`/`CodexPanel` reachable via the I/X toggles: constructing
them, loading mod content into them, and registering `ui/
PopupToggleListener` (implements `GameListener`) to handle open/dismiss/
mutual-exclusion/focus-restore — the same behavior `EastPanel` used to
provide, just as a small standalone class instead of a full sidebar panel
(it has to live in `ui/`, not nested in `Main`, for
`ModuleDependencyTest`'s engine/UI ArchUnit gate — `Main`'s own
UI-dependency exemption doesn't extend to classes nested inside it). There
is no player-info display feeding `updatePlayer` right now. The descriptions below of `InventoryPanel`/`CodexPanel`
themselves are unaffected either way.

**Screen flow** (`Main.java` and screen panels): `Main.loadGame()` first calls
`loadAndApplyDefaultTheme()` (loads the mod registry and applies `core:default`'s
theme — see `docs/ui-widgets.md`'s "Widget theming") before building any screen, then uses
`CardLayout` to manage four screens: title, game, settings, and keybinds,
navigated via a shared `cards` map + `navigateTo()` helper (needed because
settings and keybinds reference each other - a genuine two-way cycle plain
lambda capture can't express, since Java lambdas can't forward-reference a
local variable declared later in the same method). `TitleScreenPanel` and
`SettingsScreenPanel` are each real `Widget`-style Swing focus targets in
their own right (focusable, with their own `InputMap`/`ActionMap` bound at
`WHEN_FOCUSED`) rather than relying on an inner child widget to hold real
focus - `navigateTo()` calls `requestFocusInWindow()` on whichever screen a
navigation lands on, matching the same bind-and-delegate idiom
`InventoryPanel` already established for composite screens with mixed
navigation.

`TitleScreenPanel` shows the "VEIL" title (with Delta Corps Priest 1 font, or
monospaced fallback if the font resource is absent) and a centered menu
(Continue, New, Load, Settings, Exit) — New navigates to the game view and
starts the game loop, Settings opens the settings screen, and Exit quits the
application via `System.exit(0)` (the same shutdown `JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE`
already performs when closing the window via its title bar; Continue and Load
remain non-functional placeholders). `SettingsScreenPanel` is a centered, bordered, navigable,
back-able list of eleven settings items, every row sharing one width (matching
the widest row, same convention `RadioGroupWidget`'s vertical mode already
uses): Brightness and Volume (both sliders, rendered as an actual bar via
`SliderWidget.getDisplayText()`), Fullscreen (radio toggle: Windowed/
Fullscreen; toggling it live-applies to the real game window — undecorated
and maximized for Fullscreen mode, resizable and decorated for Windowed,
with the `Camera` viewport tracking the live panel size so resizing reveals
more or less map), Font (radio cycle: Monospaced/Serif/SansSerif), Theme (radio
cycle: Default/Midnight/Sunrise — a fixed placeholder list built the same way
as Font's, purely visual and not wired to the real mod-driven theme registry
described in `docs/ui-widgets.md`'s "Widget theming"), Keybinds (opens
the dedicated keybinds page), placeholder action items (Open Game Folder,
Open Mod Folder - both call `Desktop.open`, creating `mods/` next to the
install if missing; About, Reset to Defaults), and an explicit Go Back item
(added after Step 4.5 playtest found Escape-only back navigation wasn't
discoverable). Left/Right calls `moveLeft()`/`moveRight()` on sliders or
radio groups directly (bypassing their own now-unused internal key bindings,
same as `InventoryPanel`'s sub-widgets), which updates the highlighted
option **and immediately persists it** (see "Settings persistence" below);
Up/Down navigates the menu; Enter triggers actions; Escape or Go Back
returns to the title screen. Its "Reset to Defaults" row opens a
`ResetConfirmationPopup` (a `CompactPopupWidget` asking "Reset
all settings to their defaults?" via a horizontal `RadioGroupWidget<String>`
defaulting to "No", the same safe-default convention `DropConfirmationPopup`
uses); choosing "Yes" resets Brightness/Fullscreen/Font/Theme/Volume (not
Keybinds — that has its own separate reset, see below) to their hardcoded
defaults and persists the result, choosing "No" dismisses without changing
anything. `SettingsScreenPanel` doesn't host that popup
inside its own layout, mirroring `InventoryPanel`/`GameWindow`'s approach:
`ui/SettingsWindow.buildContentArea(SettingsScreenPanel)` builds a
`JLayeredPane` with the settings screen at `DEFAULT_LAYER` and the reset
popup at `POPUP_LAYER` above it, stretched to match via `FillLayout`, and
`Main.java` wires that layered pane into the settings card instead of adding
`SettingsScreenPanel` directly.

`SettingsKeybindsPanel` lists every rebindable action (Move up/down/left/
right, Toggle inventory) and its current key in a real `TableWidget<ActionRow>`
(Action/Key columns, bordered grid, header row - the same widget
`InventoryPanel` uses for its field/value table), allows navigation between
actions and a footer (Go back, Reset to Defaults, Cancel, Apply - left to
right), and opens a "press any key" popup on Enter to capture an arbitrary
key as a new binding (a `KeyListener`, not `InputMap`/`ActionMap`, since it
must catch any keystroke while armed rather than a fixed set). Rebinding a
key calls `TableWidget.updateRow()` to refresh just that row's Key cell
without disturbing the selected row - `setRows()` would have reset selection
to the first row on every keypress. The armed action row gets a green accent
border via `TableWidget.setSelectedRowAccentColor()` (the same
`WidgetTheme.VALID_HIGHLIGHT` convention `RadioGroupWidget`'s confirmed-option
border already uses), and every other row dims via
`TableWidget.setOtherRowsDimmed()`, so the armed row reads as the only
currently-active thing, like a modal dimming its backdrop. Rebind edits
accumulate in a pending table; a separate `committedBindings` snapshot (synced
from `settings.json` at construction and re-synced whenever Apply runs) is
what pending reverts back to. The footer actions now have real, distinct
meaning: **Apply** persists the pending table and returns to the Settings
screen; **Cancel** and **Go back** both discard pending edits back to the
committed snapshot — asking a "Discard unsaved keybind changes?" confirmation
first only if something's actually pending — but differ in navigation
(Cancel stays on this page, Go back/Escape leave to Settings); **Reset to
Defaults** now asks its own "Reset all keybinds to their defaults?"
confirmation first, then only stages the hardcoded defaults as a pending
edit (matching every other rebind — still requires Apply to persist, so a
Reset the player never Applies is just another unsaved change subject to
the same discard confirmation). Both new confirmations reuse
`ResetConfirmationPopup`'s widget shape via its two-arg constructor
(custom title/question text, same `setOnYes(Runnable)` hook mechanism as
the main screen's), hosted via a new `ui/SettingsKeybindsWindow` (mirrors
`SettingsWindow`'s `JLayeredPane` pattern, since this page previously had no
popup host at all). Actual key rebinding still doesn't retarget real input
dispatch — `Keybindings.java`'s `KeyStroke` constants are unrelated and
untouched; this page's `Map<String,String>` is a persisted display-only
label, not real key binding.

**Settings persistence** (`com.swiftfaze.veil.config`): `SettingsConfig` is a plain,
Gson-serializable data holder (Brightness/Fullscreen/Font/Theme/Volume plus
a Keybinds map, and a WindowWidth/WindowHeight pair — see below) whose
no-arg constructor's field initializers are the single source of truth for
"defaults" — reused both as the fallback when `settings.json` is
missing/corrupt/partial and as what Keybinds' own Reset to Defaults
stages. `SettingsRepository` reads/writes `settings.json` next to the
install (`Path.of("").toAbsolutePath()`, the same base
`Main.openFolder`/`ModLoader.load` already treat as "the install"); a
missing file, unparsable JSON, or a `keybinds` object missing some actions
all fall back to defaults for just the affected value(s), never a crash.
`SettingsStore` wraps one `SettingsRepository` plus the single loaded
`SettingsConfig` instance and is constructed once in `Main.loadGame` (not
per-screen) specifically so `SettingsScreenPanel` and `SettingsKeybindsPanel`
share the same in-memory config object — each screen only ever mutates the
fields it owns, but since both hold a reference to the same instance,
neither screen's `persist()` call can clobber a change the other screen
already made in the same session.

**Windowed size persistence**: `WindowWidth`/`WindowHeight`
default to `0`, a sentinel meaning "nothing saved yet, let the window
`pack()` to its natural size" — unlike the other fields above, they're not
a main-screen settings row and are deliberately excluded from
`resetToDefaults()`, the same way Keybinds is. `Main` registers a single
JVM shutdown hook (`registerWindowSizeShutdownHook`) that captures the live
frame's size into these fields and persists them only if the window is
still in Windowed mode when the app quits (checked via
`!frame.isUndecorated()`); a Fullscreen-mode quit leaves whatever was
previously saved untouched. `applyWindowMode`'s Windowed branch restores
and clamps that saved size (independently per axis, to
`[MIN_WINDOW_WIDTH, screenBounds.width]` /
`[MIN_WINDOW_HEIGHT, screenBounds.height]`) both at launch and on a live
Fullscreen→Windowed switch, reusing the same immediate-callback-fire
mechanism `SettingsScreenPanel.setOnWindowModeChanged()` already uses to
apply a persisted Fullscreen setting at launch.

`InventoryPanel` extends `PopupWidget`: its body is a 50/50 split
(`GridLayout`) between an item `ListWidget<Item>` on the left (scrollable
via a `JScrollPane` styled with `TerminalScrollBarUI`, non-wrapping) and a
details pane on the right (name/type/slot/damage range/effects table,
refreshed live off the list's `onSelectionChange` hook), divided by a 2px
light-gray line matching the rest of the UI's border style. The effects are
rendered as a `TableWidget<Item.Effect>` with two columns (stat and value),
row-highlighted when selected. Navigation can be switched between the item
list and the effects table via Left/Right keys; Up/Down then navigate within
the current pane. Pressing D (Drop) from any pane opens a nested
`DropConfirmationPopup` (a `CompactPopupWidget` containing a
horizontal `RadioGroupWidget<String>` asking "Drop item?", defaulting to "No"
highlighted), which closes on any selection or Escape without actually
removing items. It's
populated externally (`showItems(List<Item>)`, called from
`Main.wirePopups`) rather than loading mod content itself.
`ui/GameWindow.buildContentArea(GamePanel)` builds a `JLayeredPane`
wrapping just `GamePanel` at `DEFAULT_LAYER`; `Main.buildGameCard` then
adds the inventory popup and its nested drop-confirmation popup directly
(`POPUP_LAYER`/`DRAG_LAYER`) rather than `GameWindow` doing it — that
layering logic used to live inside `GameWindow` itself, driven by an
`EastPanel` parameter, before that composition root was removed (see the
UI shell note above). `SelectableMenu` (the old hand-rolled index-wrap
counter `MenuPanel` used to drive) is deleted entirely, superseded by
`ListWidget`.

**Controls hint bar** (`ui/widget/ControlsHintBarWidget`, see
`docs/ui-widgets.md`): `Main.loadGame()` builds one shared instance and
threads it through every screen's constructor, docked at the game frame's
`BorderLayout.SOUTH`. Each screen computes its own current hint list and
calls `hintBar.setHints(...)` whenever a row/sub-focus change would change
what's valid to press — `TitleScreenPanel`'s hints are static (set once);
`SettingsScreenPanel.computeHints()` adds Decrease/Increase for a slider row
or Previous/Next for a radio row, on top of a fixed Select/Back tail;
`SettingsKeybindsPanel.computeHints()` switches between its table, footer,
and press-any-key-capture hint sets based on `footerFocused`/`popupOpen`;
`InventoryPanel`/`CodexPanel` swap a Back-to-list/View-details hint based on
`detailsPane.hasFocus()`. Plain vertical list movement's Up/Down is
deliberately omitted from every one of these — assumed player knowledge,
unlike a row-specific effect (Decrease/Increase, Previous/Next, "Back to
list") or the in-game view's non-arrow Z/S/Q/D movement scheme, which still
gets shown since it isn't self-explanatory the same way. `Main.navigateTo()`
re-pushes the newly-focused screen's hints on every `CardLayout` switch via
the `HintAware` interface, since a screen's own key-bound methods only cover
in-screen focus changes, not screen switches. Only Title/Settings/Keybinds
are wired into the live `Main` composition root today — Inventory/Codex/the
in-game view's hint pushes are exercised directly against the panel classes
in `controls-hint-bar.feature`, pending the composition-root rebuild
mentioned in the UI shell note above (see that feature file's Non-goals for
why).

`CodexPanel` extends `PopupWidget` and mirrors `InventoryPanel`'s list+detail
split structure: a tab switcher across Items, Tiles, and Classes (three
`JLabel`s styled as tabs with selection highlighting) above a 50/50 split body
with a category-specific entry list on the left (scrollable `ListWidget`,
non-wrapping) and a field/value detail table on the right (`TableWidget`
showing ID, Name, Glyph/Symbol/Color, etc. per category). Up/Down/Left/Right
navigate within the current pane and can switch focus between list and detail
via Left/Right. Tab and Shift+Tab cycle forward/backward through tabs. Data is
populated externally from mod content (`showItems`/`showTiles`/`showClasses`)
same as `InventoryPanel`. Opening Codex via the X key while Inventory is
open still closes Inventory first, and vice versa, so only one popup is
ever visible at a time — that mutual exclusion moved from
`EastPanel.toggleCodex()`/`toggleInventory()` into `Main`'s
`PopupToggleListener` (see the UI shell note above) when `EastPanel` was
removed, same behavior either way. Buildings and Quests tabs are deferred.
`InventoryPanel` and `CodexPanel`'s
duplicated details-pane/focus-navigation code is being extracted per
`docs/components.md`; see that doc's worked example.

`PauseMenuPopup` extends `PopupWidget` and provides an ESC-triggered pause overlay during gameplay: a centered menu listing Resume / Settings / Exit to Main Menu (selected via Up/Down arrow keys, confirmed via Enter; Escape dismisses or selects Resume). It follows the same `PopupWidget` pattern as Inventory/Codex — added to the game's `JLayeredPane` at `POPUP_LAYER` in `Main.buildGameCard` and toggled open/closed via a `PauseToggleListener` (implements `GameListener`) registered with `GamePanel`, same as `PopupToggleListener` handles Inventory/Codex mutual exclusion and focus restoration. When opened, the pause menu sets `GamePanel.paused = true` to freeze movement input (the `MoveAction` inner class checks this flag before moving the player), ensuring the game actually pauses rather than merely hiding the view behind the popup. Selecting Resume or pressing Escape again dismisses and resumes gameplay (`setOnDismiss` callback resets `paused = false`). Selecting Settings navigates to the Settings screen with `backTarget = "pause"` so that backing out returns to the pause menu rather than the title screen (game remains paused underneath). Selecting Exit to Main Menu calls `GamePanel.resetState()` (a fresh `Player`/`WorldScene`, cleared and rebuilt `entitiesToDraw`, `paused` cleared) and navigates back to the title card — an in-place reset rather than disposing/rebuilding the whole window (the old F5 hot-reset dispose-and-`loadGame()`-again approach was removed as part of the Fullscreen/Windowed live-toggle work; see `fullscreen-windowed-toggle.feature`). `GamePanel`'s movement `Action`s read the current `player` field dynamically (a lambda per direction, not a bound method reference) so they keep moving the right instance after a reset swaps it out.
