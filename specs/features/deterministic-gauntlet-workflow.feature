Feature: Deterministic-gauntlet alignment of the agentic workflow
  `.claude/workflow.md` and root `CLAUDE.md` are brought closer to Robert
  C. Martin's own description of how he runs agentic coding: a real PMD
  fix-loop before acceptance tests, a mechanically-enforced module
  dependency rule alongside PMD/JaCoCo/PITest, documented parallel
  fan-out guidance, a documented rationale for tunable complexity/
  coverage thresholds, a default agile slice-by-slice implementation loop
  (full intent -> spec -> approval reserved for high-risk work), and
  `specs/intent/` no longer treated as a permanently indexed artifact.

  Scenario: A compliant module layering passes verify
    Given no class outside `com.swiftfaze.veil.ui` imports from `com.swiftfaze.veil.ui`
    And no class in `com.swiftfaze.veil.ui.widget` imports from a screen class directly in `com.swiftfaze.veil.ui`
    When `mvn verify` is run
    Then the build succeeds

  Scenario Outline: A module-layering violation fails the build
    Given <violation>
    When `mvn verify` is run
    Then the build fails with an ArchUnit violation report identifying the offending class and the violated dependency rule

    Examples:
      | violation                                                                          |
      | a class in `game`, `world`, `entities`, `input`, `mods`, `exceptions`, or `sandbox` imports a class from `com.swiftfaze.veil.ui` |
      | a class in `com.swiftfaze.veil.ui.widget` imports a screen class directly in `com.swiftfaze.veil.ui` |

  Scenario: A screen class depending on a widget class is allowed
    Given a screen class directly in `com.swiftfaze.veil.ui` imports a class from `com.swiftfaze.veil.ui.widget`
    When `mvn verify` is run
    Then the ArchUnit module-dependency check does not fail the build over that import

  Scenario: Step 4's handoff requires closing the PMD loop before acceptance tests
    Given `.claude/workflow.md`'s Step 4 (Implementation) section
    Then it states the implementing agent must run PMD, fix any violations, and rerun PMD until clean before proceeding to Step 5 (Acceptance tests)
    And this is described as a deterministic loop the agent must satisfy, not a one-time self-check against the `uncle-bob-craft` checklist alone

  Scenario: workflow.md documents parallel fan-out as a normal option
    Given `.claude/workflow.md`'s Step 4 (Implementation) section
    Then it documents running independent Step 4 implementations in parallel (separate worktrees or separate fresh Haiku agents) as a normal option for multiple ready tickets, not only as an edge-case exception

  Scenario: workflow.md documents the complexity/coverage thresholds as a tunable dial
    Given `.claude/workflow.md`'s Constraints section
    Then it states the function-length, cyclomatic-complexity, parameter-count, and coverage thresholds are a deliberate, adjustable dial for agent-authored code, not a fixed constant
    And it states that future changes to these numbers must be a documented, deliberate experiment rather than undocumented drift

  Scenario Outline: The implementation path depends on feature risk category
    Given a feature classified as "<risk category>"
    Then `.claude/workflow.md` requires "<required path>" before implementation code is written

    Examples:
      | risk category                                          | required path                                                          |
      | standard (not auth/payments/data-integrity/public API) | a short intent doc, then an agile slice-by-slice implementation loop (implement a slice, look at the result, reconcile the intent doc, continue) — no human-approved `.feature` file required before code exists |
      | high-risk (auth/payments/data-integrity/public API)    | the full intent -> Gherkin spec -> human approval gate, unchanged from today |

  Scenario: specs/intent/README.md no longer requires lockstep Index updates
    Given `specs/intent/README.md`
    Then it no longer requires every intent doc add, remove, or rename to update the Index table in the same change
    And existing Index table entries remain as historical record

  # Non-goals:
  #   - Any actual game feature or player-visible behavior change.
  #   - The PMD/JaCoCo gate implementation itself (already delivered by
  #     pmd-jacoco-quality-gates.feature / #123).
  #   - Moving PIT mutation testing into CI as a gate, or any other change
  #     to Step 6 — untouched by this issue.
  #   - Changing `specs/features/*.feature`'s status as an executable,
  #     indexed artifact — only `specs/intent/*.md`'s ceremony is reduced.
  #   - Imposing or relaxing any TDD (test-driven development) discipline
  #     on implementing agents — neither `.claude/workflow.md` nor root
  #     `CLAUDE.md` currently mandates strict test-first TDD, so there is
  #     nothing to change here (confirmed during spec drafting).
  #
  # Risks:
  #   - The real package layout has no literal "screens" subpackage —
  #     screen classes (TitleScreenPanel, SettingsScreenPanel, CodexPanel,
  #     InventoryPanel, SettingsKeybindsPanel, GameWindow, SettingsWindow,
  #     and panel-composition classes) sit flat in com.swiftfaze.veil.ui
  #     alongside the ui.widget subpackage. Resolved via the intent doc's
  #     Clarifications: "screens" is defined as "classes directly in
  #     com.swiftfaze.veil.ui, excluding ui.widget" for ArchUnit purposes.
  #   - Flipping the default implementation path away from full
  #     intent->spec->approval is a significant process change; the
  #     high-risk carve-out (auth/payments/data-integrity/public API)
  #     must stay unambiguous so it isn't accidentally skipped for
  #     something that should get the full gate.
  #
  # Open questions:
  #   - None outstanding — settled via a grilling round during spec
  #     drafting on 2026-09-01, cross-referenced against the primary-source
  #     Robert C. Martin interview transcript.
