Feature: UML export shows Veil's structure with CRAP and mutation colouring
  The goal is Uncle Bob's live viewer (`io.github.unclebob/uml-viewer`), with
  its CRAP and mutation colouring, running on Veil's Java code rather than
  Veilclj's Clojure, which the author can't read.

  The viewer is language-neutral: it takes
  `{:classes [{:id :name :ns :stereotype}] :edges [{:from :to :kind}]}`
  (`:kind` is `:dependency` or `:implements`) and reads metrics from
  `.metrics/`, keyed by class `:ns`.

  `com.swiftfaze.veil.testing.uml.UmlExport` (test scope) walks
  `com.swiftfaze.veil..` with ArchUnit's `ClassFileImporter` (already a
  dependency) and writes `target/uml/veil.edn`, with `:ns` set to each
  class's fully qualified name. Metrics come from `.metrics/crap.edn`
  (crap-gate.feature) and from PIT's `mutations.xml` (PIT gains the `XML`
  output format beside `HTML`), converted to Veilclj's `.metrics/mutate/`
  shape. `docs/uml/veil.policy.edn` encodes the layers from
  `docs/architecture.md` (engine below `ui`, `ui` below `Main`), so the viewer
  draws a layer violation in red where ArchUnit would catch it.

  This file is `@manual-verification`: the end result is a diagram in an
  external viewer, checked by opening it.

  Covers: the export, the mutation-metrics conversion, the policy file, and
  the viewer command.
  Supersedes: nothing. ArchUnit's `ModuleDependencyTest` stays the gate; the
  viewer is a picture of it.
  Out of scope: a Clojure `:java` scanner registered with the viewer (route
  b), and running the viewer in CI.

  Scenario: The export lists every Veil class once
    Given a compiled Veil build
    When UmlExport runs
    Then `target/uml/veil.edn` has one class entry per top-level class under `com.swiftfaze.veil`
    And each entry's `:ns` is the class's fully qualified name

  Scenario: Interface implementation becomes an `:implements` edge
    Given `PopupToggleListener` implements `GameListener`
    When UmlExport runs
    Then there is an `:implements` edge from `PopupToggleListener` to `GameListener`

  Scenario: A field, parameter or call dependency becomes a `:dependency` edge
    Given `Main` references `GamePanel`
    When UmlExport runs
    Then there is a `:dependency` edge from `Main` to `GamePanel`

  Scenario: Classes outside Veil's packages are not exported
    Given Veil classes that depend on `java.util` and `javax.swing` types
    When UmlExport runs
    Then no class or edge names a `java.` or `javax.` type

  Scenario: PIT mutation results are converted to the viewer's shape
    Given a PIT run that wrote `target/pit-reports/mutations.xml`
    When the mutation-metrics conversion runs
    Then `.metrics/mutate/` contains results keyed by fully qualified class name, in the shape uml-viewer's overlay reads

  Scenario: A missing PIT report skips the mutation overlay, not the diagram
    Given no `mutations.xml` exists
    When the export and viewer run
    Then the diagram opens with CRAP colouring and no mutation colouring
    And the export says the mutation report was missing

  Scenario: The viewer opens with CRAP colouring
    Given `mvn verify` has written `.metrics/crap.edn`
    When the author runs the viewer command
    Then a diagram of the Veil packages opens
    And classes are coloured by their worst method's CRAP score

  Scenario: A planted layer violation shows red
    Given a planted dependency from a `ui` class to `Main`
    When UmlExport and the viewer run
    Then that edge is drawn red as a layer violation

  # Non-goals:
  #   - Explaining the code. The viewer shows structure; pair the first run
  #     with a walkthrough of docs/architecture.md against the diagram.
  #   - A new layering rule. The policy file mirrors ArchUnit, never adds to it.
  #
  # Risks:
  #   - The .metrics/mutate/ shape is Veilclj's, keyed for Clojure
  #     namespaces. The spike must check it against uml-viewer's overlay code
  #     before writing the converter.
  #   - Nested and anonymous classes (Main$1): exporting them clutters the
  #     diagram; folding them into their outer class matches how
  #     crap.edn keys by class.
  #
  # Open questions:
  #   - None. Route (a) and the local-only Clojure CLI toolchain in
  #     tools/uml/ are approved (intent, Clarifications).
